# Hydra-Apply

Gnome extension to apply random wallpapers using [Hydrapaper](https://hydrapaper.gabmus.org).

### Currently only works with the flatpak version of Hydrapaper.

Uses systemd-run to create transient timers that will run the hydrapaper flatpak with the -r command line option. 

Only tested on Pop_Os with X11.
